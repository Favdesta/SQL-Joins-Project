# SQL Joins Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains my work from completing an advanced SQL Joins course. Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of SQL join operations using a practical bookstore database example.

## What I Learned
Throughout this project, I mastered three key SQL concepts:

1. **Inner, Left, and Right Joins**
   - Implemented various join types on a bookstore database
   - Created queries to connect customer orders with customer information
   - Linked books with their respective authors

2. **Self-Joins and Cross-Joins**
   - Built queries to show employee-manager relationships using self-joins
   - Explored cross-join applications for generating all possible book-author combinations

3. **UNION and UNION ALL Operations**
   - Combined customer and supplier city data using UNION
   - Learned the distinction between UNION and UNION ALL through practical examples

## Project Implementation

### Database Structure
I worked with a bookstore database containing the following tables:
- `customer` (customer information)
- `orderinfo` (order details)
- `item` (book information)
- `author` (author details)
- `employees` (staff data)
- `supplier` (supplier information)

### Key Achievements
1. **Inner Join Implementation**
   - Created queries to match orders with customer details
   - Connected books with their authors
   - Achieved clean data relationships between tables

2. **Left/Right Join Development**
   - Built queries showing all customers and their orders (if any exist)
   - Created book listings including those without assigned authors
   - Learned to handle NULL values effectively

3. **Advanced Join Operations**
   - Developed self-joins for employee-manager relationships
   - Implemented cross-joins for comprehensive data analysis
   - Mastered UNION operations for combining related data

## Code Examples
You can find my implemented queries in the [queries.sql](queries.sql) file. Each query is thoroughly commented to explain its purpose and functionality.

## Skills Developed
- Advanced SQL query writing
- Database relationship management
- Data analysis through various join types
- Query optimization
- Practical database design understanding

## Future Improvements
- Add more complex join scenarios
- Implement subqueries with joins
- Add performance optimization examples
- Include more real-world use cases

## Technologies Used
- MySQL
- MySQL Workbench
- Sample Bookstore Database
